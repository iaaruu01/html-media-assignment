    <h1>Programming Quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> “Sometimes, it pays to stay in bed on Monday rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code.” </li>
        <li>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</li>
        <li> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?</li>
        <li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."</li>
        <li>Give a man a program, frustrate him for a day. Teach a man to program, frustrate him for a lifetime.</li>
    </ul>
